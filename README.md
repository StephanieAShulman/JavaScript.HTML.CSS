## Resources
* Data Source: An array of UFO sightings that occurred 1/1/20-1/13/20 throughout the United States
* Software: Visual Studio Code 1.65.0
* Libraries: JavaScript's Data Driven Documents Library (D3)
* Applications/Languages: Chrome DevTools, HTML, JavaScript, CSS

## Project Overview
For this project, JavaScript, HTML and CSS were employed to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world. Steps included:
* Converting the existing JavaScript array into an HTML table.
* Modifying the table with JavaScriptâ€™s D3 library to allow users the ability to filter data.
* Simplifying the code with for-loop iterations and achieving more concise functions with the use of fat arrow notation.
* Engaging Chrome DevTools to test code as the process progressed.
* Stylizing the webpage with CSS to include colors and an image.
* Producing a more interactive session by changing the original event listener from a click to element filters, aided by an if-else statement to detect which input statements have changed.

## Results
The final result is an interactive site that allows the user to search for sightings based on date, city, state, and shape. The user can enter all information (if known) or limit inquiries to a single request. This webpage will accommodate either approach.

## Final Considerations
This webpage is a good first step in generating insight into potential planetary visitors. Although there is a great deal of information prior to filtering, it is laid out in easy-to-read columns and rows.

Drawbacks to the site include:
* The lack of instruction on how to reset the site (ie, clicking on the UFO Sightings wording at the top).
* The inability to know what specifics are covered, such as time horizon and shape.
* The inclusion of redundant data that add confusion, specifically the term "country" when the data cover the United States only.

Future updates should consider the use of a button design and term (such as "Reset") and a drop-down menu listing the specifics of each category to improve usage. It may be that clues to current Visitors lie within this data!
